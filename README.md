## About Project
SBF App is built with Streamlit.

This is a personal project created purely just to analyse projects with charts that were of personal choices. To benefit the bigger community, am deciding to make it available on the open web for folks to upload their data to analyse their own data.

## Background
Crawling data from HDB website is already challenging enough. Not having a dashboard to analyse the data from different angles has been a constant challenge for most people that are participating in the exercise.

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
streamlit run homepage.py
```
